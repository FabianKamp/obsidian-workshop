> [! Abstract]
> Human learning is a complex phenomenon requiring flexibility to adapt existing brain function and precision in selecting new neurophysiological activities to drive desired behavior. These two attributes—flexibility and selection—must operate over multiple temporal scales as performance of a skill changes from being slow and challenging to being fast and automatic. Such selective adaptability is naturally provided by modular structure, which plays a critical role in evolution, development, and optimal network function. Using functional connectivity measurements of brain activity acquired from initial training through mastery of a simple motor skill, we investigate the role of modularity in human learning by identifying dynamic changes of modular organization spanning multiple temporal scales. Our results indicate that flexibility, which we measure by the allegiance of nodes to modules, in one experimental session predicts the relative amount of learning in a future session. We also develop a general statistical framework for the identification of modular architectures in evolving systems, which is broadly applicable to disciplines where network adaptability is crucial to the understanding of system performance.

> <mark style="background-color: #fbf485">Modular, or nearly decomposable (7), structures are aggregates of small subsystems (modules) that can perform specific functions without perturbing the remainder of the system. Such structure provides a combination of compartmentalization and redundancy, which reduces the interdependence of components, enhances robustness, and facilitates behavioral adaptation (8, 9). </mark>  
> **Comment**: modular structures are more robust and enhance behavioral adaption
